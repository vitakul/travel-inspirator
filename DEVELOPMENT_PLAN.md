## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `users` - User profiles linked to Supabase Auth
- `family_groups` - Family group management (max 5 members)
- `family_members` - Many-to-many relationship between users and groups
- `places` - Geographic locations with categories, ratings, and metadata
- `routes` - Travel routes connecting multiple places with enhanced metadata
  - `estimated_duration`, `difficulty_level`, `transport_mode`, `total_distance`
- `route_places` - Many-to-many relationship for route waypoints with enhanced features
  - `transport_to_next`, `notes`, `estimated_time`, `order_index`
- `photos` - Image storage metadata linked to places/routes

### Key Features
- PostGIS integration for geographic queries
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- Enum types for place categories, family roles, route difficulty, and transport modes
- JSONB fields for flexible metadata storage
- Database functions for enhanced queries (`get_routes_with_details`, `get_route_waypoints`)

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. **Start Supabase**: `supabase start`
2. **Run Dev Server**: `npm run dev` (port 5173)
3. **Type Generation**: `npm run types`
4. **Test Data**: `./recreate_data.sh`

### Test Accounts
- **john@example.com** (password: password123) - Family Admin
- **jane@example.com** (password: password123) - Family Member

### Key Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with HMR
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run types` - Generate TypeScript types from Supabase
- `supabase db reset` - Reset local database
- `./recreate_data.sh` - Recreate test data

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
- Redux Toolkit slices for places, family, auth, routes
- Async thunks for API calls with comprehensive CRUD operations
- Typed selectors and dispatchers
- Route management with waypoint ordering and transport configuration

### Map Integration
- Leaflet.js with React wrapper for interactive mapping
- Leaflet Routing Machine with OSRM for real routing paths
- Custom MapController for automatic centering and bounds fitting
- PostGIS coordinate extraction with `get_places_with_coordinates()` function
- RouteMap component with numbered waypoints and drag & drop editing
- Per-segment routing based on transport modes (walking/driving/cycling)
- Transport mode indicators and waypoint popups with editing capabilities

### Authentication Flow
- Supabase Auth with protected routes
- User profile management
- Session persistence

### API Integration
- Photon API for location autocomplete
- Supabase RPC functions for complex queries
- Proper error handling and loading states

## Known Issues Resolved

1. **PostGIS Coordinate Parsing**: Fixed binary data issue by creating `get_places_with_coordinates()` function with proper geometry casting
2. **RLS Policy Recursion**: Resolved infinite recursion by simplifying policies and using security invoker functions
3. **Navigation Issues**: Fixed 406 errors by replacing static links with React Router NavLinks
4. **Modal Z-Index**: Fixed modals appearing behind map using React Portals and high z-index values
5. **Autocomplete Dropdown**: Fixed persistence issues with proper state management and click-outside detection
6. **Development Workflow**: Implemented single dev server approach with Vite HMR instead of multiple servers

## Next Steps

1. **Photo Upload Feature** - Add image management with Supabase Storage
2. **Enhanced Search** - Create advanced filtering and search capabilities
3. **Real-time Updates** - Implement live collaboration features
4. **Mobile Optimization** - Ensure responsive design across all devices
