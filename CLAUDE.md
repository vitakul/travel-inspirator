## Development Commands

### Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Vite Development Server & HMR
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (http://localhost:5173)
- `npm run build` - Build project and check TypeScript errors
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

#### üî• Hot Module Replacement (HMR) Best Practices
1. **Start server once**: `npm run dev` - Keep running throughout development
2. **Automatic reloading**: Vite HMR detects file changes and updates browser instantly
3. **Preserves state**: Component state maintained during updates
4. **Error checking**: Use `npm run build` to verify TypeScript without restarting server
5. **Consistent URL**: Always use http://localhost:5173 throughout development

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid Multiple Dev Servers
- **Don't restart unnecessarily** - HMR handles most changes automatically
- **Only restart for**: Major config changes, dependency updates, or port conflicts
- **Kill existing servers**: `pkill -f "vite.*dev"` if multiple servers are running

### Database
- `supabase start` - Start local Supabase instance (requires Docker)
- `supabase db push` - Apply pending migrations without losing data (PREFERRED)
- `supabase db push --dry-run` - Preview what migrations would be applied
- `supabase db reset` - ‚ö†Ô∏è DESTRUCTIVE: Reset local database with migrations (ONLY use when absolutely necessary)
- `supabase db diff` - Generate migration files from schema changes
- `npx supabase gen types typescript --local > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` - Regenerate TypeScript types
- `./setup_data.sh` - Setup test users and seed data (idempotent - preserves existing data)
- `./fix_data.sh` - Fix data issues (profiles without names, places without owners)
- `./recreate_data.sh` - ‚ö†Ô∏è DESTRUCTIVE: Recreate test users and seed data (only after db reset)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Database Migration Best Practices
1. **NEVER use `supabase db reset` unless absolutely necessary** - it wipes all data
2. **Always use `supabase db push` to apply new migrations** - preserves existing data
3. **Run `supabase db push --dry-run` first** to preview changes
4. **Only reset database if there are breaking schema changes** that require it
5. **Always run `./recreate_data.sh` after a reset** to restore test data

### üîß Common Data Issues & Solutions

**Problem: "No data in app after database operations"**
- **Symptoms**: App shows no places, profiles missing names, user can't create family groups
- **Root Cause**: Database operations can leave profiles without proper names and places without ownership
- **Quick Fix**: Run `./fix_data.sh` to repair data relationships
- **Prevention**: Use `./setup_data.sh` instead of `./recreate_data.sh` when possible

**Migration Workflow Summary:**
1. For schema changes: `supabase db push` (preserves data)
2. For data issues: `./fix_data.sh` (repairs relationships)
3. For clean slate: `supabase db reset` + `./recreate_data.sh` (nuclear option)

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **users** - User profiles and authentication
- **family_groups** - Family group management (max 5 members)
- **family_members** - Junction table for group membership
- **places** - Travel destinations with location data
- **routes** - Collections of connected places with enhanced metadata
  - `estimated_duration`, `difficulty_level`, `transport_mode`, `total_distance`
- **route_places** - Junction table for route-place relationships with waypoint features
  - `transport_to_next`, `notes`, `estimated_time`, `order_index`
- **photos** - Image storage references

### Key Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Geographic indexes for location queries
- Enum types for route difficulty and transport modes
- Database functions for enhanced queries (`get_routes_with_details`, `get_route_waypoints`)
- Real-time subscriptions for collaborative features
- Public/private content filtering

## Database Operations

### Common Patterns
- Always use typed Supabase client with Database type
- Implement RLS policies for data security
- Use upsert operations for create/update scenarios
- Handle auth state in queries (user-specific data)

### Supabase Integration
- Local development requires Supabase CLI and Docker
- Database migrations in `supabase/migrations/`
- Types auto-generated from database schema
- Environment variables for local/remote switching

## State Management

### Redux Store Structure
```typescript
interface RootState {
  auth: AuthState;
  places: PlacesState;
  routes: RoutesState;
  family: FamilyState;
  settings: SettingsState;
}
```

### Real-time Updates
- Supabase subscriptions for live collaboration
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits

## API Integration

### External APIs
- **OpenStreetMap/Photon API** - Place autocomplete and geocoding (implemented)
- **Leaflet.js** - Interactive map rendering (implemented)
- **Supabase Storage** - Image upload and management (pending)

### Data Flow
1. User interactions update local state
2. Redux actions trigger API calls
3. Supabase handles persistence and real-time sync
4. Components re-render with updated data

## Component Architecture

### Core Components
- `Modal` - Reusable modal with React Portal and z-index handling
- `PlaceForm` - Comprehensive place creation with location autocomplete
- `RouteBuilder` - Complete route creation form with waypoint management
- `RouteMap` - Advanced route visualization with OSRM routing, numbered waypoints, and drag & drop editing
- `WaypointList` - Drag & drop waypoint ordering with visual indicators
- `PlaceSelector` - Modal for selecting places with search and filtering
- `MapComponent` - Leaflet integration with click handlers and markers
- `Navigation` - React Router NavLink-based navigation
- `Header` - Shared app header with user dropdown and settings
- `PlaceCard` - Place display component with ratings and categories

### Page Structure
- `Dashboard` - Overview with quick actions and recent places
- `Places` - Place management with search, filtering, and map interaction
- `Routes` - Complete route creation and management with RouteBuilder integration
- `Family` - Family group management interface
- `Settings` - User preferences for language, currency, and privacy settings

### State Slices

- `settingsSlice` - User preferences for language, currency, and privacy

## Security Considerations

### Row Level Security Policies
- Users can only access their family group data
- Public content filtering based on is_public flag
- Admin-only operations for family group management

### Authentication
- Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- Protected routes in React Router
- Session management and refresh handling

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- React Query for API cache management
- LocalStorage for offline data
- Service Worker for PWA support

### Map Performance
- Marker clustering for dense areas
- Lazy loading of route details
- Geographic bounds optimization

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Component testing with Jest/React Testing Library
- Redux store and action testing
- Utility function testing

### Integration Tests

- Environment variables for API keys and URLs

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Netlify deployment on merge to main
- Database migration deployment strategy

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Strict type checking enabled
- Interface definitions for all API responses
- Generic types for reusable components

### React
- Functional components with hooks
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Component composition over inheritance

### CSS
- Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Component-scoped styles when needed
- Responsive design patterns

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Modal Z-Index Problems
**Symptoms**: Modal appears behind map or other elements
**Solution**: Modal uses React Portal + high z-index (10000+)
```css
.modal-overlay {
  z-index: 10000 !important;
}
.leaflet-container {
  z-index: 1;
}
```

#### Authentication Errors
**Symptoms**: "Invalid login credentials" for test accounts
**Solution**: Run `./recreate_data.sh` to recreate auth users properly

#### Multiple Dev Servers
**Symptoms**: Port conflicts, changing localhost URLs
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Kill all existing servers
pkill -f "vite.*dev"
# Start single server
npm run dev
# Use http://localhost:5173 consistently
```

#### Database Connection Issues
**Symptoms**: "Connection refused" or RLS policy errors
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Check Supabase status
supabase status
# Restart if needed
supabase stop && supabase start
```
